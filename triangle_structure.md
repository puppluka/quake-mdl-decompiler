The `.tri` file format is a relatively simple binary format designed to store a list of triangles, primarily for 3D model geometry.

Here's a breakdown of its structure and layout:

1. **Magic Number (4 bytes, Big-Endian):**
   
   - The very first 4 bytes of the file contain a "magic number." This is a fixed value (`123322` or `0x1E1F2` in hexadecimal) that acts as an identifier to confirm that the file is indeed a `.tri` file.
   - It's crucial to note that this `int` value (`IDTRIHEADER`) is written in **Big-Endian** byte order (most significant byte first) according to the `WriteTriFile` function (`WriteBigLongToBuffer(magic_bytes, IDTRIHEADER);`).

2. **Number of Triangles (4 bytes, Little-Endian):**
   
   - Immediately following the magic number is a 4-byte integer that specifies the total number of triangles contained within the file.
   - This value is written in **Little-Endian** byte order (least significant byte first), which is typical for Quake's core `.mdl` files and common on x86 architectures (`WriteLittleLong(f, num_triangles);`).

3. **Triangle Data (Variable Length):**
   
   - After the number of triangles, the rest of the file consists of the actual triangle geometry data.
   - Each triangle is defined by **3 vertices**, and each vertex has **3 floating-point coordinates** (X, Y, Z).
   - The data for each float is written directly as 4 bytes, in **Little-Endian** format, mirroring how `float` values are typically stored in memory on a Little-Endian system.
   
   So, for each triangle, you would find:
   
   - Vertex 1:
     - X-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Y-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Z-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
   - Vertex 2:
     - X-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Y-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Z-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
   - Vertex 3:
     - X-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Y-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)
     - Z-coordinate (4 bytes, Little-Endian float)

This sequence repeats for `num_triangles` times. There is no additional information like normals, texture coordinates, or colors stored directly in the `.tri` file itself; it's purely for raw vertex geometry, which is why it often needed to be combined with data from `.mdl` files (which contain skin/texture data, ST vertices, and vertex indices) to form a complete model.
